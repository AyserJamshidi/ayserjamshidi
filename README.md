# <p align="center">Hi everyone, I'm Ayser Jamshidi!</p>

### I'm a Developer and a Senior CS Student at [Temple University][temple_website]! I'm also...
- 👩‍💻 Actively working on [OutOfStonk][outofstonk_repo] - a program built on Java using frameworks like Selenium and JUnit (must cut down on bugs!) and eventually having a website built with BootStrap.
- 📚 Currently learning... everything 🤣
- 💬 Seeking an job or co-op for **Summer 2022**
- ❓ Thinking about how to create a fun and engaging YouTube video revolving around game hacking, memory viewing, multi-level pointers and Assembly instruction overriding/code cave redirects...
- 🎈 Fun fact: I have the [world record score][3dmark_myscore] on [3DMark's TimeSpy][3dmark_general] leaderboard for every computer system that contains a 5900HS processor and a 3070 mobile graphics chip.
- ⚡ 2022 Goals: Earn an internship where I can make a difference in the world, graduate with at least a 3.8 and to successfully publish OutOfStonk on all possible channels (Its own website, Discord, chrome extension, ...).
